# Bike Share Data Analysis Provided by Udacity
This is a repo for the professional Data Analysis Professional track on Udacity

# Problem Statement. 
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.  



# Solutions provided by the repo
*Interactive type:
-Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?  

-Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?  

-(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?  

-(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?  

-After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit. 

-you need to anticipate raw input errors like using improper upper or lower case, typos, or users misunderstanding what you are expecting.  

-Your script also needs to prompt the user whether they would like want to see the raw data. If the user answers 'yes,' then the script should print 5 rows of the data at a time, then ask the user if they would like to see 5 more rows of the data. The script should continue prompting and printing the next 5 rows at a time until the user chooses 'no,' they do not want any more raw data to be displayed.  


# Requirements
1- Python environment. 

2- Pandas library.  

3-A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
