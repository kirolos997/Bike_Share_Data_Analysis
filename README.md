# Problem Description
*Interactive type:
-Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?  

-Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
-(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
-(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?
-After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.
-you need to anticipate raw input errors like using improper upper or lower case, typos, or users misunderstanding what you are expecting.
-Your script also needs to prompt the user whether they would like want to see the raw data. If the user answers 'yes,' then the script should print 5 rows of the data at a time, then ask the user if they would like to see 5 more rows of the data. The script should continue prompting and printing the next 5 rows at a time until the user chooses 'no,' they do not want any more raw data to be displayed.
